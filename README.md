# UniversalGamepad
XBox One controller in combination with Universal App's.

This project delivers some sample code to use the XBox One gamepad buttons in a Universal App environment.
The built in polling system with .GetCurrentReading() is hidden and replaced by events which I think are more easy to write extra code around. It's written around the Windows.Input.Gaming API in c#.

Have fun!
